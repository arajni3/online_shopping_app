# online_shopping_app
A full stack online shopping web app. The backend is implemented using Node and Express to implement the server and its route handlers, Bcrypt for password encryption, and MongoDB and Mongoose
to connect to and utilize MongoDB as a database for storing JSONs. The frontend is implemented using React for the UI and client-side state management, Bootstrap and Flexbox for easy CSS styling, React Router for navigating between webpages,
and Axios for sending HTTP requests to the server (specifically, by making XMLHttpRequests).
